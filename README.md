# Regression-model-for-car-pricing

In data analytics, we often use Model Development to help us predict future observations from the data we have.
A model will help us understand the exact relationship between different variables and how these variables are used to predict the result.

## Overview of Project
In this project, several models are developed that will predict the price of the car using the variables or features. 
This is just an estimate but should give us an objective idea of how much the car should cost.
The dataset used for this project is available on: "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Data%20files/automobileEDA.csv".

In this, 3 models i.e. Simple Linear Regression Model, Multiple Linear Regression Model and Polynomial Regression Models are created, 
evaluated using Regression Plot and Residual plot and are 
compared using Measures of In-sample evaluation such as R^2 error and Mean-squared error 
in order to determine the best fit for the dataset to predict outputs from it.
